# Random-Quote-Generator
freeCodeCamp Intermediate Front-End Developer Project

This project was built using plain 'ol javascript.  I had the option of using jQuery but I opted to use just vanilla Javascript.  I wanted to get a deeper understanding of the langauge before messing with any libraries or frameworks.  I will, in the near future, build another quote generator using jQuery and maybe a framework like angular.

Enjoy.
